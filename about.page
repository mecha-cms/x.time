This extension automatically generates a `time.data` file if it does not exist on a particular page folder to ensure
that the page creation time data remains consistent when you move pages across file systems. You donâ€™t need this
extension if you are used to creating pages via [Panel](https://github.com/mecha-cms/x.panel) extension. It will
generate the file for you every time you create a new page.
